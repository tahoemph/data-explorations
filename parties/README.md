# House changes

This came from wanting to explore the question that Obama's first
mid-term House flop was the worse since 1929.  I'd seen language
like "huge" that seems unqualified to me.  How far out was it
relative to others?  Then on looking it appeared to me like it
wasn't even the worse since 1929.  I found a
(data set)[https://www.infoplease.com/history-and-government/us-government/composition-congress-political-party-1855-2017]
that seemed reasonable and was easy to get into a form that could
be analyzed.
